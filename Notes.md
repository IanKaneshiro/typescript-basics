# TypeScript

- Type checking is immediate shown in Vs Code
- You can compile with tsc <name of your file>

### Type Annotation

- We can tell it the type of variable.
- "Type Annotation" => let myVar: type = value
- Its all lower case

### Compiling TypeScript

- At the end of the day we will compile to javascirpt
- using tsc <name of file>

### Type Inference

- Most of the time we can rely on type inference
- TypeScript will figure out what varaibles are supposed to be.

### Any Type

- Any is a escape hatch
- It allows you to set anythings to any!
